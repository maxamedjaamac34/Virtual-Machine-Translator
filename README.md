# Virtual-Machine-Translator
translate virtual machine instructions to hack assembly instructions


This program takes in a file storing virtual machine commands like push, pop, lt, gt and others and generates the hack assembly code for the program. 

This is an assignment for course Systems II taught by Darcy Otto of Bennington College. The course is based on the Nand2Tetris course by Shimon Schocken and Noam Nisan. 

If you are doing the assingments through chapters 7 and 8 in the book *'the-elements-of-computing-systems-second-edition-building-a-modern-computer-from-first-principles'*, please first do the assignment and then read my solutions for comparisons, further education. 

**Do not use it to satisfy assessment requirements.**
